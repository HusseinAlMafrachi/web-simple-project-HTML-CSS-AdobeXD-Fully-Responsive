=======

- Developed a static website using HTML and plain CSS, showcasing a responsive design to ensure optimal user 
experience across various devices. This project provided hands-on experience in creating adaptable layouts 
and marked a significant step in my journey from using plain CSS for responsiveness to gaining a deeper 
understanding of the development and design cycle principles, while honing my UI/UX design skills. 

- Additionally, I utilized Adobe XD to plan and design the layout and user flow, ensuring a clear and 
user-centered structure before development.
